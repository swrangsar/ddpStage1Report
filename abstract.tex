\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
Our goal is to set up an OpenBTS system with cognitive capabilities. We decide on a frequency channel, to run our cognitive OpenBTS system in, beforehand. First we sense the presence of ongoing calls made by primary users in the predefined frequency channel. If there are ongoing calls in that channel then we wait for the calls to end. As soon as the calls made by primary users end, we start our secondary OpenBTS system to allow secondary users to make calls.
