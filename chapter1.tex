\chapter{A cognitive base station using GnuRadio and OpenBTS}
\section{Target}
Our aim in this project is to start a secondary base station in some predefined frequency band used by a 
primary base station as soon as that particular frequency band becomes available (i.e. when the calls in 
the primary base station end).
