\chapter*{\centering{Abstract}}
Our goal is to set up an OpenBTS system with cognitive capabilities. We decide on a frequency channel, to run our cognitive OpenBTS system in, beforehand. First we sense the presence of ongoing calls made by primary users in the predefined frequency channel. If there are ongoing calls in that channel then we wait for the calls to end. As soon as the calls by the primary users end the energy in that channel goes low. GNU Radio detects this change and it provides the ARFCN, corresponding to this channel, to the secondary BTS system and the secondary BTS starts using this ARFCN allowing secondary users to make calls and send SMSs.
