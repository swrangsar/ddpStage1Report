\begin{abstract}

Our goal is to set up an OpenBTS system with cognitive capabilities. We have a predefined frequency band to run our cognitive OpenBTS system in. First we sense the presence of primary users in that particular frequency band by detecting the presence of ongoing calls. If it turns out that the calls made by primary users end, then we start our secondary OpenBTS system thus allowing secondary users to make calls.
