\section{Cognitive Radio}
A cognitive radio is an intelligent radio that can be programmed and configured dynamically. Its transceiver is designed to use the best wireless channels in its vicinity. Such a radio automatically detects available channels in wireless spectrum, then accordingly changes its transmission or reception parameters to allow more concurrent wireless communications in a given spectrum band at one location. This process is a form of dynamic spectrum management\cite{wikiCR}.

\section{Motivation}
Studies have shown that most of the spectrum allotted to licensed networks remain unused most of the time\cite{repFCC}. To utilize these unused spectral resources we can make use of dynamic spectrum management. We can allow secondary (unlicensed) users to utilize the spectrum whenever that particular spectrum becomes available. For this we need cognitive capabilities to sense the availability of the spectrum.
